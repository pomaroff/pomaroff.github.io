The ceremony will be followed by canapés and drinks on the lawn overlooking the stunning Yarra Valley.

Enjoy some lawn games, food, and drink whilst watching the sunset over the hills.

## Reception

The celebrations will continue as we move into the dining room, enjoying a feast, (more) drinks, cake, and plenty of laughs.

Don't forget to bring your dancing shoes!
