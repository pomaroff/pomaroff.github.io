## Venue

The entire day will take place at *The Riverstone Estate* to make the most of this stunning vineyard. <i class="fas fa-wine-glass icon style4"></i>

We're sure you'll love the venue as much as we do, being perched on top of a hill with a near 360-degree view of the surrounding Yarra Valley in all of its Autumn colour.

We can't wait! <i class="fas fa-grin-beam icon style4"></i>
