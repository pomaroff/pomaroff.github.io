## What to wear

Dress **formal**, but be mindful of the weather forecast!

It will get chilly during the evening, so we recommend that you bring a jacket.<br />
Parts of the day will take place on the amazing lawn at The Riverstone Estate, so stilettos may not be the best option.

## Coronavirus

I'm sure everyone knows the drill by now.<br />
The venue requires every attendee to bring proof of COVID-19 vaccination.

## The Schedule

### 1. Ceremony

Please arrive and be seated by **{{site.start_time}}** for the ceremony at The Riverstone Estate.

Weather permitting, the ceremony will take place outdoors on the lawn.

### 2. Canapés

The ceremony will be followed by canapés and drinks on the lawn overlooking the stunning Yarra Valley.

Enjoy some lawn games, food and drink whilst we enjoy watching the sunset over the hills.

### 3. Reception

The celebrations will continue into the evening as we move into the dining room.<br />
Here, we will enjoy a feast, drinks, cake and plenty of laughs by the fireplace.

Don't forget to bring your dancing shoes! <i class="fas fa-music icon style4"></i>

### 4. Conclusion

Unfortunately, all good things must eventually come to an end!

We will be saying our farewells at approximately **{{site.end_time}}**.
